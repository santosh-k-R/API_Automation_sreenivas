Though the virtual network interface cards/virtual host bus adapters show as green in UCSM, the underlying storage paths might still be down when affected.",
            "background": "If the egress FC port is congested, the switch sends Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) frames to the servers in order to reduce the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) rate and avoid packet drops with defined Class of Service (CoS) priority. Data Center Bridging (DCB) PFC extends the standard PAUSE frame to include IEEE 802.1p CoS values. With PFC, instead of halting all traffic on the link when a PAUSE frame is sent, traffic is paused only for those CoS values that are enabled in the PFC frame. A PFC frame is sent for the enabled priority for which traffic needs to be paused.This problem has the potential to manifest under several different conditions: - The IOM is reset. - The IOM is reseated. - The cable between the IOM and the FI is pulled/replaced. - The Unified Computing System (UCS) is upgraded and infrastructure components (A-bundle) are completed before adapters (B/C-bundle). In Cisco bug ID CSCuh61202 the switch/IOM sends Pause Registers (Priority Groups (PGS) and PFC updates) to the adapter, specifically a PGS update followed by a PFC update. Because of an issue in the VIC firmware, when the PFC update happens the pause configuration does not get programmed correctly. This results in the adapter not honoring the pause for the FCoE CoS. This leads to dropped FCoE frames on the IOM.Cisco bug ID CSCus64439 is triggered by a sequence of events on the VIC adapter in which PFC might not be correctly reconfigured after it receives a PFC Inoperative frame followed by PFC Operational frame. This results in the adapter not honoring the pause for the FCoE CoS. This leads to dropped FCoE frames on the IOM.As this behavior is a race condition, it can occur on some servers, but not others. Typically it might be observed in an entire chassis. However when there are multiple chassis in the system, the chassis with the correct Pause configuration can still be affected due to the amount of traffic that is flooded onto the network.",

            "workaround": "Dependent upon the situation, customers can choose a temporary/immediate workaround or the preferred workaround. Immediate Workaround: Reboot the blade that floods traffic to the IOM. This results in the pause configuration being reprogrammed. Preferred Workaround: This method is to avoid this issue long-term. If an upgrade is to be performed; plan the upgrade such that the adapters (B/C-bundle) firmware gets upgraded prior to the infrastructure components (A-bundle). It is recommended to upgrade all components in the system from the blade to the FI in the same maintenance window so the system does not sit in disparate versions.If you plan to upgrade from any 2.2x to 3.1x releases, upgrade B/C-bundle to 2.2(6g) first, then upgrade to the 2.2(6g) A-bundle. Afterwards you can upgrade to 3.1x in the normal order.If you plan to upgrade from any 2.1x to 2.2x/3.1x releases, upgrade B/C-bundle to 2.1(3k) first, then upgrade to the 2.1(3k) A-bundle. Afterwards you can upgrade to 2.2.x/3.1x in the normal order.Release 3.1(1e) or 2.2(6g) and its subsequent releases that contain fixes for all defects mentioned in this notice can be found at Cisco Software Download Release 2.2 and later. Refer to Upgrading Cisco UCS from Release 2.1 to Release 2.2. How to Avoid Further Problems In order to avoid this issue, it is required to upgrade the Cisco 1225/1227/1240/1280/1340/1380 Adapter firmware before you update the UCS infrastructure components (UCSM/IOM/FI). This procedure goes against the grain of Cisco's UCS upgrade guide, but in order to avoid this issue it is recommended.",

            "background": "Today, there are options for the partner or customer to change the DECT frequency of a CP-8831 to a locally compliant band. The DECT microphone ships disabled and only becomes enabled when a user attempts to pair a microphone. The expectation was that customers and partners would follow our instructions to change the frequency band if needed. When the UCM administrator configures the wireless microphone region to the region appropriate for that country, the frequency band is made correct for that country. However, there have been a few isolated incidents whereby the wireless microphone region had not been set and the 8831 defaulted to the locale for the product or North America if the locale was not set. This causes the product to operate with DECT frequencies that are out of compliance for that country.",
            "problemSymptoms": "If product is not specifically configured to the DECT wireless microphone region for the country it operates within, it could operate outside the established DECT frequency range for that country.",
            "workaround": "As there is no product defect, there is no requirement from Cisco for customers to return product already deployed at their sites.Ensure the Product is Configured Correctly on UCM Administrator If the customer experiences a problem with the DECT band on the 8831 not meeting their region&#39;s compliance specifications, the customer should follow these instructions from the Maintain and Operate guide, page 10 under Wireless Microphone Region Setting.The default value for the Wireless Microphone Region setting is United States. If you use the device in a locale outside the United States and you configure a wireless microphone to pair with the device, you must change the Wireless Microphone Region setting to your region. This change is required to ensure that the wireless microphone is operated within the licensed bandwidth for the region and therefore can be operated in accordance with radiocommunications license conditions and without causing interference with other radiocommunications services.Use Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration to change the Wireless Microphone Region setting.Procedure for Interim Work-Around 1. In Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration, go to Device > Phone.2. Use the Find capability to find the Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831.3. In the Product Specific Configuration Layout area of the Phone Configuration window, change the Wireless Microphone Region setting to the region where the device is located. The drop-down box lists the available regions.Procedure for Solution: Apply Software Load Cisco is making region-specific software available to customers in the form of an engineering special. In certain countries, each 8831 is required to be locked down to the relevant DECT region for the respective country and the Engineering Special (ES) load will be pushed out to 8831 customers. In other cases, if customers request that an 8831 be locked down to a DECT region for their respective country, a Technical Assistance Center (TAC) case can be opened to get access to the ES load. Note that once this firmware is applied, the 8831 will be locked to the DECT region and will cease to default to the configuration received from the UCM administrator.Solution for New Orders of 8831 Moving forward, Cisco is creating region-specific PIDs that will be locked down at manufacturing time to the wireless microphone DECT region based on the PID ordered. The PIDs are identified in these charts. There might be a small number of customers who cannot or will not change the DECT frequency on their 8831&#39;s. For those customers, contact 8831-radiofrequency@cisco.com for replacement options.====================================================For those devices deployed in Australia, Europe, Taiwan, Japan and Brazil, or any region that does not use the North American spectrum for DECT signaling, a firmware upgrade is mandatory. Complete the steps below in order to upgrade the software. Failure to do so might violate local regulations. (Devices deployed in countries not listed here can also use 10.3.1(SR2) without concern.)In order to prevent the 8831 V02 from downgrading firmware before it connects to the network when the CUCM default load is 9.3.3, complete these steps:1. Download 10.3.1-SR2 from Cisco.com .2. Load the 10.3.1-SR2 firmware onto the TFTP server .3. Restart the TFTP service on the CUCM.4. Point the new 8831s to the 10.3.1-SR2 load from the administration page for each new device.5. Connect a new 8831 to the network, and it will upgrade to 10.3.1-SR2.Workaround In order to recover CP-8831 V02 units that have already downgraded, complete these steps:1. Download cmterm-8831-sip.9-3-3-TO-10-3-1-v2.zip from Cisco.com2. From the TFTP File Management Page, load the cmterm-8831-sip.9-3-3-TO-10-3-1-v2.zip firmware onto the TFTP server.3. Restart the TFTP service on the CUCM.4. Point the new 8831s to the cmterm-8831-sip.9-3-3-TO-10-3-1-v2.zip load from the administration page for each new device.5. Point the new 8831s to the 10.3.1-SR2 load from the administration page for each new device.6. Connect a new 8831 to the network.7. Initiate reset to load 10.3.1-SR2.",

These ASR 903 routers were shipped before August 27, 2014.If the fan filter (ASR903-FAN-F) is installed with the wrong orientation inside the fan tray (ASR903-FAN-E), then the filter needs to be reinserted correctly per the procedure detailed in the Workaround/Solution section.",
            "background": "It was noticed that if the fan filter is installed with wrong orientation (as described in the How to Identify Affected Hardware section), the fan filter can shear the insulation on the hot wire (red wire) and expose the conductor when it is pulled out. This is caused by the straight part of the metal sheet on the filter that faces the wire, when the filter is installed in the wrong direction.When the filter is reinserted, there is a chance that the exposed wire in the fan tray might short when it comes in contact with the metal frame of the filter. This will shut down the fan tray, but it will not cause a safety hazard.In order to fix the issue, remove the fan filter that was installed with the wrong orientation and reinsert it in the correct orientation (with the metal frame of the filter facing the fans) per the procedure detailed in the Workaround/Solution section.",
            "problemSymptoms": "When you remove/reinsert the fan filter, the fan tray might shut down if it has caused a short (12V to Ground short) when it comes in contact with the metal frame of the fan filter. Also, when the filter is removed, the customer could notice that the sheath on the wire has been peeled off which exposes the conductor in the fan tray.",
            "workaround": "Fan filters need to be correctly oriented inside the fan tray. Use the Fan Filter Removal  and Reinsertion Procedure in order to  rectify the issue.Notes:- The intent of this procedure is to remove the filters and reassemble them in the correct orientation without damage to the projected wires.- The filter removal and reinsertion procedure has to be completed within a time frame of five minutes as mentioned in the Installation Guide in order to avoid a thermal shutdown. If there is a spare fan tray available, it can be installed while the filter orientation change is completed.- Use ESD protective gear while you perform these procedures.- Use a Philips head screw driver in order to access the fasteners.Fan Filter Removal and Reinsertion Procedure1. Remove the fan tray along with the filter from the chassis as shown in this image.   a. Ensure the fans no longer rotate.   b. Do not remove or pull out the filter.  ** Insert Image for Step 12. Remove the two screws on one side of the fan tray (as shown in this image) in order to remove the filter cover  on the front of the fan tray. Retain the two screws for reassembly.  ** Insert Image for Step 23. Lift up and pull out the filter as indicated in this image.   a. Remove and retain the filter guide, which was initially secured by the screws.   b. Remove the filter and clean if necessary.  ** Insert Image for Step 34. Inspect the wires to make sure there is no damage (such as sheath peeled off which exposes the conductor). In case of damage to the wire, use the Return Material Authorization (RMA) process in order to return the fan tray.  ** Insert Image for Step 45. If there is NO damage to the wires, reinstall the two screws removed previously in order to reassemble the filter guide.      Ensure the guide is pulled slightly up in the assembly process in order to make sure it is seated well and in line with the other  guide. See this image for details.  ** Insert Image for Step 56. Insert the filter back into the fan tray in the correct orientation as shown in this image. In the correct orientation, the metal side of the filter faces the fans and the foam side of the filter faces out.  ** Insert Image for Step 6",

            "background": "Cisco has found this issue to be present at its manufacturing sites. It is also possible that units already in the field have O-rings that will be dislodged via the removal of a dust cap that secures the connectors.",
            "problemSymptoms": "This problem can arise from dust caps that are over-tightened in the initial product assembly. When the dust cap is over-tightened, it makes contact with the internal O-ring and over compresses it. The combination of this over compression, time, and temperature/humidity fluctuations during storage/transit can contribute to the internal O-ring lightly bonding to the dust cap.  Once this internal O-ring becomes lightly bonded to the dust cap, there is a possibility that it will become dislodged from the connector upon removal of the dust cap.",
            "workaround": "Perform the visual inspection steps as described in the Problem Identification section. If you discover that an O-ring on an IE2000 switch is missing or has been dislodged and the switch is no longer deemed to be IP67 compliant (due to the missing O-ring), then the solution is to obtain a hardware replacement for the affected switch. Note that the inventory within MFG and Service might still exhibit the same issue, so be careful when you remove the dust caps and verify that the O-rings are still present.",

This latency is most common on ESAs with many features enabled, which include clustering and Security Management Appliance (SMA) connections that can contribute to the overall system lag.For earlier software versions, there is a gradual slowdown due to excessive memory swapping. The current AsyncOS handles light and medium swapping situations with no noticeable lag, but heavy swapping situations result in the system entering a halt state. For the ESA platform, the duration of this halt state has been observed to be up to 5 minutes.This issue causes slowness on the entire system and work queue backups or slowness when browsing (in the case of WSA platform).

The main feature that is affected will be the Access Point (AP)-to-controller joining. The secondary feature that is affected will be new mobility connections between the controllers.When an AP attempts to establish a new connection, the AP fails to join. When you configure mobility between controllers, they will fail to establish a connection.The likelihood that this issue will be encountered is 100% for wireless products in use (to include APs and controllers) that have a Manufacturer Installed Certificate (MIC) that is older than ten years.

            "workaround": "Temporary WorkaroundIf you believe that your product(s) will be affected by this issue and need a fix before the official code with the associated correction is posted at www.cisco.com, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). The TAC will work to provide an escalation code accordingly.Recovery for Failed APsNote: This workaround should only be used in order to allow the APs with expired certificates to join the WLCs just long enough to upgrade the software.If the certificates have expired, disable Network Time Protocol (NTP), and then change the WLC clock time to a recent earlier time when the certificates were still valid. If you set the clock back too far, the newer APs might not be able to join. Once the software has been upgraded, and the affected APs have joined, the WLC clock should be reset to the valid time.Note: When you temporarily disable NTP and change the WLC time settings, it can adversely affect other time-dependent WLC features, such as MFP, Simple Network Management Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3), and Location.SolutionUpgrade to a software version that contains the fix. Cisco has released the fix for Cisco bug ID CSCuq19142 to www.cisco.com for AireOS Versions 7.0.252.0, 7.4.140.0 and 8.0.120.0.For further guidance regarding AireOS releases, see:- TAC Recommended AireOS - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/wireless-lan-controller-software/200046-TAC-Recommended-AireOS.html- Guidelines for Cisco Wireless Software Release Migration Bulletin, http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/8500-series-wireless-controllers/bulletin-c25-738147.htmlNote: Because the 4400 Series WLCs were among the first manufactured and had both Airespace and Cisco MICs installed, the current fix for Cisco bug ID CSCuq19142 might not work. The Airespace MIC is given precedence by the WLC, and the fix for Cisco bug ID CSCuq19142 is only applicable for Cisco MICs. This is potentially applicable to most 4400 Series WLCs that were manufactured in 2005, and other variants, dependent upon the Return Material Authorization (RMA) and refurbishment history of the affected unit. Refer to the How to Identify Hardware Levels section of this Field Notice for information about how to determine the date of manufacture. If the affected unit was refurbished, the Serial Number (SN) might have changed with the MIC remaining the same. Presently, the only remedy is to disable NTP, and then change the WLC clock time to a recent earlier time when the certificates were still valid. Contact the TAC in order to get an escalation image with the fix for Cisco bug ID CSCuu02970.By default, if an AP and/or WLC certificate has expired, then the DTLS connection will fail. In order to allow the APs to join a WLC after the certificate expiration, upgrade to the fixed software version, and then use the appropriate command for your specific version.For Version 7.0.252.0, use this command:(WLC)>config ap lifetime-check {micssc} enableFor Versions 7.4.140.0 and later, use this command:(WLC)>config ap cert-expiry-ignore {micssc} enableWith these commands in effect, the WLC and AP will ignore the expiration date on the device MICs and SSCs. These commands must remain in effect as long as the devices with expired MICs or SSCs are used.",

These memory components are widely used across the industry and are included in a number of Cisco products.Although the majority of Cisco products using these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, some components may fail earlier than anticipated. A handful of our customers have recently experienced a higher number of failures, leading us to change our approach to managing this issue.While other vendors have chosen to address this issue in different ways, Cisco believes its approach is the best course of action for its customers. Despite the cost, we are demonstrating that we always make customer satisfaction a top priority. Customers can learn more about this topic at Memory Component Issue web page.PLEASE NOTE - The products listed in this Field Notice have lower than expected failure rates. This assessment is based on actual usage of affected memory components, observed field failure rates and product replacements since 2012.A degraded component will not affect the ongoing operation of a device, but will be exposed by a subsequent power cycle event. This event will result in a hard failure of the device, which cannot be recovered by a reboot or additional power cycle. For these reasons, additional caution is recommended for operational activities requiring the simultaneous power cycling of multiple devices. This issue has been observed most commonly on devices that have been in service for 24 months or more.",

This assessment is based on actual usage of affected memory components, observed field failure rates and product replacements since 2012. \r\n\r\nA degraded component will not affect the ongoing operation of a device, but will be exposed by a subsequent power cycle event. This event will result in a hard failure of the device, which cannot be recovered by a reboot or additional power cycle.

Details are in the Workaround/Solution section.\r\n\r\nAll units with serial numbers between FOC1926xxxx and  FOC1952xxxx are affected.",
            "background": "In manufacturing there was a component change to the DCU that requires new firmware in order to operate. The original firmware 9.3.3 does not contain the driver necessary to operate the DCU. That driver is only available in firmware versions 10.3.1-SR1 and later.\r\n\r\nThe 10.3.1-SR1 firmware does not have the blocker that prevents the 8831 from downgrading to an earlier firmware version.\r\n\r\nCustomers who have standardized on the 9.3.3 firmware, for example, will see their new 8831 downgrade to 9.3.3 automatically which disables the operation of the DCU.\r\n\r\nEven if the customer completes a Return Material Authorization (RMA) for the 8831 and installs a new replacement 8831, the same problem occurs because of the way the firmware is managed.",
            "problemSymptoms": "CP-8831 boots up to either a blank LCD or an LCD that shows the Cisco logo at installation. The unit shows registered in CUCM and might receive calls, but no calls can be placed.",
            "workaround": "All units with serial numbers between FOC1926xxxx and FOC1952xxxx are affected.\r\n\r\nFor CP-8831 devices with a V01 designation, no action is required. These devices do not have the new DCU hardware and therefore have no driver dependency within the firmware.\r\n\r\nFor CP-8831 devices with a V02 designation, in order to prevent this issue from occurring, see the Solution section. If this issue has already occurred and is need of recovery, see the Workaround section.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, at the time of this release, that 10.3.1(SR2) will not yet be published. In that case use 10.3.1(SR1). \r\n\r\n<b>Solution</b>\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the 8831 V02 from downgrading firmware prior to connection to the network when the CUCM default load is 9.3.3, complete these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Download 10.3.1-SR2 from Cisco.com.\r\n2. Load the 10.3.1-SR2 firmware onto the TFTP server.\r\n3. Restart the TFTP service on the CUCM.\r\n4. Point the new 8831 to the 10.3.1-SR2 load from the administration page for each new device.\r\n5. Connect a new 8831 to the network and it will upgrade to 10.3.1-SR2.\r\n\r\n<b>Workaround</b>\r\n\r\nIn order to recover CP-8831 V02 units that have already downgraded to 9.3.3, complete these steps:\r\n1. Download cmterm-8831-sip.9-3-3-TO-10-3-1-v2.zip from Cisco.com.\r\n2. Load the cmterm-8831-sip.9-3-3-TO-10-3-1-v2.zip firmware onto the TFTP server from the TFTP File Management Page.\r\n3. Restart the TFTP service on the CUCM.\r\n4. Point the new 8831 to the cmterm-8831-sip.9-3-3-TO-10-3-1-v2.zip load from the administration page for each new device.\r\n5. Connect a new 8831 to the network.\r\n6. After the 8831 has upgraded to 9-3-3-TO-10-3-1-v2, point the 8831 to the 10.3.1-SR2 load from the administration page for each new device.\r\n7. Initiate reset to load 10.3.1-SR2.\r\n\r\nFirmware releases 10.3.1 SR2 and later contain the downgrade blocker.",

            "background": "Cipher is an algorithm used to perform encryption or decryption in the SSH protocol. The CDE250 IPMI firmware versions 3.09 and earlier have weak cipher. The CDE250 system utilizes IPMI in order to monitor and manage the health of the system. This function is implemented with embedded IPMI firmware that runs within the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) that resides on the motherboard. The new security enhancement in IPMI version 3.12 improves the cipher.\r\n\r\nThe SDT utility versions 2.112 and earlier directly access the BMC and do not validate the I2C bus availability. This possibly causes contention issues which could result in I2C bus hang. SDT version 2.113 addresses this particular issue.",

In the near term, immediately reboot the deployed security appliances in order to prevent this issue.  The Cisco ISA3000 units shipped with manufacturing image ASA 9.6.2 are not impacted. These devices are impacted only if the customer has upgraded the software to any of the affected versions.",
            "background": "On March 29, 2017 Cisco became aware of an issue that affects all Cisco ISA3000 security appliances that run certain versions of software. The affected versions of software cause the security appliance to stop passing network traffic after approximately 213 days 12 hours (~ 5,124 hours) of uptime.  The issue detailed in this Field Notice is not a security vulnerability and there is no associated risk to the integrity of the security appliance.",
            "problemSymptoms": "The Cisco ISA3000 security appliances stop passing all network traffic.  Entering the show asp drop command over the console port will indicate that packets are being dropped due to the reason Punt rate limit exceeded (punt-rate-limit).",
            "workaround": "In order to mitigate the risk and impact of the device not passing network traffic, Cisco urges customers to proactively reboot their Cisco ISA3000 security appliances that run affected versions of the software.  For customers with failover configurations, it is recommended to reboot the standby devices first, make them active after they complete booting, and then reboot the formerly active devices.  The reboot of the security appliance must be performed prior to 213 days 12 hours of uptime. After the reboot, the security appliance avoids an encounter with this issue for another 213 days 12 hours.  Enter the show version  grep up command in order to display the uptime of the security appliance.  The output is shown here:  ciscoasa# show version  grep up Config file at boot was \"startup-config\" ciscoasa up 210 days 11 hours  The device can be rebooted with one of these methods:  - CLI - Enter the reload command in privileged mode - ASDM GUI - Choose Tools > System Reload  A physical power-cycle can be used in order to perform a reboot.
