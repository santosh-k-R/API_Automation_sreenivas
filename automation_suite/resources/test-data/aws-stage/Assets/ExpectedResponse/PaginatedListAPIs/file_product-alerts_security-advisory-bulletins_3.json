The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the handling of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) heartbeat extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by implementing a malicious TLS or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) client, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected server, or a malicious TLS or DTLS server, if trying to exploit the vulnerability on an affected client. An exploit could send a specially crafted TLS or DTLS heartbeat packet to the connected client or server. An exploit could allow the attacker to disclose a limited portion of memory from a connected client or server for every heartbeat packet sent. The disclosed portions of memory could contain sensitive information that may include private keys and passwords. Please note that the devices that are affected by this vulnerability are the devices acting as an SSL server terminating SSL connections or devices acting as an SSL Client initiating an SSL connection. Devices that are simply traversed by SSL traffic without terminating it are not affected. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

On June 5, 2014, the OpenSSL Project released a security advisory detailing seven distinct vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are referenced in this document as follows: SSL/TLS Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability DTLS Recursion Flaw Vulnerability DTLS Invalid Fragment Vulnerability SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS Session Injection or Denial of Service Vulnerability Anonymous ECDH Denial of Service Vulnerability ECDSA NONCE Side-Channel Recovery Attack Vulnerability Please note that the devices that are affected by this vulnerability are the devices acting as a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) server terminating SSL or DTLS connections or devices acting as an SSL client initiating an SSL or DTLS connection. Devices that are simply traversed by SSL or DTLS traffic without terminating it are not affected. Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities may be available.",

To avoid false negatives, we have not mapped feature rules for this advisory. It is recommended to manually check for the below POSSIBLE scenarios to determine if your device is vulnerable or not. \r\nThe devices that are affected by this vulnerability are the devices acting as a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) server terminating SSL or DTLS connections or devices acting as an SSL client initiating an SSL or DTLS connection. Devices that are simply traversed by SSL or DTLS traffic without terminating it are not affected.  \r\n\r\nCisco IOS devices that support SSLVPN (AnyConnect) and have the feature configured and enabled are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAll Cisco IOS services that provide a form of TLS or SSL encryption are affected by this vulnerability. This includes features such as the HTTPS Web Management interface. Since HTTPS uses TLS so if that is configured you would be vulnerable.  However other solutions use TLS whose exhaustive list is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

            "bulletinVersion": "1.29",
            "summaryText": "On September 24, 2014, a vulnerability in the Bash shell was publicly announced. The vulnerability is related to the way in which shell functions are passed though environment variables. The vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject commands into a Bash shell, depending on how the shell is invoked. The Bash shell may be invoked by a number of processes including, but not limited to, telnet, SSH, DHCP, and scripts hosted on web servers. All versions of GNU Bash starting with version 1.14 are affected by this vulnerability and the specific impact is determined by the characteristics of the process using the Bash shell. In the worst case, an unauthenticated remote attacker would be able to execute commands on an affected server. However, in most cases involving Cisco products, authentication is required before exploitation could be attempted. A number of Cisco products ship with or use an affected version of the Bash shell. The Bash shell is a third-party software component that is part of the GNU software project and used by a number of software vendors. As of this version of the Security Advisory, there have been a number of vulnerabilities recently discovered in the Bash shell, and the investigation is ongoing.

The vulnerability is related to the way in which shell functions are passed though environment variables. The vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject commands into a Bash shell, depending on how the shell is invoked. The Bash shell may be invoked by a number of processes including, but not limited to, telnet, SSH, DHCP, and scripts hosted on web servers. All versions of GNU Bash starting with version 1.14 are affected by this vulnerability and the specific impact is determined by the characteristics of the process using the Bash shell. In the worst case, an unauthenticated remote attacker would be able to execute commands on an affected server. However, in most cases involving Cisco products, authentication is required before exploitation could be attempted. A number of Cisco products ship with or use an affected version of the Bash shell. The Bash shell is a third-party software component that is part of the GNU software project and used by a number of software vendors.

Traffic causing the disruption was isolated to a specific source IPv4 address. Cisco has engaged the provider and owner of that device and determined that the traffic was sent with no malicious intent. Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed Cisco ASA software release to remediate this issue. Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities: Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability These vulnerabilities are independent of one another; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in a reload of an affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability, and Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability may result in full compromise of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability may result in the disclosure of internal information or, in some cases, a reload of the affected system. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability may result in a compromise of the Clientless SSL VPN portal, which may lead to several types of attacks, which are not limited to cross-site scripting (XSS), stealing of credentials, or redirects of users to malicious web pages. Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability may result in a digital certificate validation bypass, which could allow the attacker to bypass digital certificate authentication and gain access inside the network via remote access VPN or management access to the affected system via the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM).

Successful exploitation of the Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability may result in a digital certificate validation bypass, which could allow the attacker to bypass digital certificate authentication and gain access inside the network via remote access VPN or management access to the affected system via the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM). Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of these vulnerabilities are available.",
