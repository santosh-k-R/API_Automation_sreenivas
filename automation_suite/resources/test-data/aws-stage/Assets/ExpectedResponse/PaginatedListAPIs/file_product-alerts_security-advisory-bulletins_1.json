The vulnerability is due to improper memory management when DHCPv6 packets are received on an interface of the targeted device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of malicious DHCPv6 packets to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the system to run low on memory, which could cause an eventual reboot of an affected device. The vulnerability only applies to IPv6 protocol packets and not for IPv4 protocol packets. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",

To exploit this vulnerability an offending IPv6 packet must be targeted to the device. Packets that are routed throughout the router can not trigger this vulnerability. Successful exploitation will prevent the interface from receiving any additional traffic.

This vulnerability could allow valid users to retrieve or write to any file on the device's file system, including the device's saved configuration and Cisco IOS image files, even if the CLI view attached to the user does not allow it.
