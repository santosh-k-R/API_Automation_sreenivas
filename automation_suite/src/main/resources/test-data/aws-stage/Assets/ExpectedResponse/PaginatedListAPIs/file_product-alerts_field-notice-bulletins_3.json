However, a message will be logged to Status Messages for all loads.",

            "workaround": "In order to troubleshoot the 8821 IP Phone when it displays \"MIC not installed\", complete these steps.Step 1. Confirm the Error MessageVerify that the phone displays the \"MIC not installed\" error message on the screen as shown in this image:If the error has disappeared, choose Settings > Admin settings > Status > Status messages in order to verify it is present as a status message.Step 2. Restore FunctionalityIf not required for wireless authentication, the MIC can be replaced with an LSC with the use of CUCM Certificate Authority Proxy Function (CAPF) so the phone operates normally. Install an LSC on the phone once the error message is confirmed and test once more. Ensure By Null String or By Authentication String is selected for the Authentication Mode in order for the LSC to be installed successfully despite the fact that the MIC is not present.In Release 11.0(3)SR3.2, the \"MIC not installed\" message in the status bar is suppressed when the LSC is installed on the phone. The message is displayed for the first 10 seconds after power on. For earlier loads an LSC can be installed on the phone and function, but the â€œMIC not installedâ€� message continues to be displayed on the phoneâ€™s status bar.Step 3. Prevent New OccurrencesUpgrade all Cisco 8821 phones to Release 11.0(3)SR3.2 or later as soon as possible, as the issue has been fixed from this version onwards. For devices that have already displayed this error message, an upgrade will not recover the MIC. The code that contains the fix for Cisco bug ID CSCvc65418 (resolved through the fix of Cisco bug ID CSCve44412) prevents disappearance of the MIC in the first place.For further assistance or if the MIC is required for wireless authentication on an affected phone, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center for a Return Material Authorization (RMA).Note: Cisco recommends that you use the latest 8821 firmware release available on Cisco.com.",

            "background": "Cisco MDS 9706 and 9710 switches are vulnerable to Cisco bug ID CSCvf99665 when they run Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.1(1). An affected switch cannot complete an upgrade or downgrade. Data switching is not affected unless a disruptive upgrade or downgrade is attempted.The root cause is a random and invalid IPv6 address and mask installed on the mgmt0 interface. This address/mask has not been installed by the user, but might have existed for a long time and been unnoticed. However, due to changes in Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.1(1) and later the system behavior is different, which leads to the issues described in the Problem Description section.For more information, which includes further details on how to determine if a switch is affected, see Cisco bug IDs CSCvf99665 and CSCvb93701.",
            "problemSymptoms": "This defect manifests with many symptoms, all related to inaccessibility of the bootflash device on either the active or standby supervisor. The signature of this issue is an invalid IPv6 address and mask in the configuration of the mgmt0 interface that the user has not configured. It has the format of '::d.d.d.d/0' where 'd' is a decimal IP address octet, as shown in this example:switch# show running-config interface mgmt 0interface mgmt0  ipv6 address ::1.1.1.255/0Various other symptoms might occur. When you upgrade to Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.1(1) the upgrade might abort after the first line card has been upgraded. When you run Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.1(1), bootflash specific commands such as dir bootflash: and system health check bootflash will fail.",
            "workaround": "Although this issue can be resolved nondisruptively, the recovery process is laborious because it cannot be resolved through normal methods. If you already run NX-OS Release 8.1(1) and have encountered the issue, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for help.For switches you plan to upgrade to any Cisco MDS NX-OS 8.1 or later release, deploy Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.1(1a) or later as the choice for the MDS NX-OS 8.1(x) step. Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.1(1a) and later releases nondisruptively autocorrect any invalid IPv6 address on the mgmt0 interface. In order to achieve this, save the running configuration post upgrade, execute a supervisor switchover, and resave the running configuration. Then proceed to the desired release as per the upgrade path outlined in the NX-OS Release Notes.",

One of the readings collected is from the temperature sensor in the memory DIMMs. In 2018, a batch of vEdge-2000 routers was manufactured with memory DIMMs that do not implement the temperature sensor and thus do not provide a sensor reading to the software. vEdge software interprets the missing temperature reading on these affected routers to be a hardware error when, in fact, the hardware functions normally.",
            "problemSymptoms": "Affected vEdge routers generate DRAM temperature hardware alarms after bootup. In order to view hardware alarms, enter the CLI command show hardware alarms or show hardware environment on the router console or remotely via vManage.

            "workaround": "Since the DRAM temperature sensor failure alarms are essentially spurious on affected vEdge routers, the easiest workaround is to simply ignore or filter those alarms. The missing DRAM sensors pose no material impact to the operation of the router. Other ambient temperature sensors in the router continue to function and monitor the thermal operations normally.There is no software fix for this problem. However, there is a hardware upgrade program available for customers who deem it essential to eliminate the source of the alarms. To order replacement vEdge routers via the upgrade program, first complete the instructions in the How to Identify Affected Products section in order to ensure your vEdge router is affected. Then complete the form in the Upgrade Program section and click Submit.Note: Retain any accessories, which include the power cord and console cable, from the original unit since replacement units shipped via the upgrade program might not include those items.",

            "background": "Issue 1 - Affects Some Battery ApplicationsSome IR809 or IR829 routers might not power down completely during a power down stage, especially when a backup battery is used to provide backup power. If a power down cycle is incomplete or an unmonitored battery discharges gradually to the point where its performance is impacted (in the voltage region where it produces large voltage fluctuations), this process produces multiple power cycle swings until the battery eventually drains below the minimum input voltage of the router. The router eventually shuts down and becomes unresponsive to subsequent power up attempts.Note: Typically, a rechargeable battery should never be allowed to drop below 10.5V for a 12V battery or below 21V for a 24V battery, as that is normally the voltage most common rechargeable batteries (lead-acid and lithium-Ion) assign a 0% state of charge. A drop below these values can affect the router and also significantly reduce the charge capacity and eventually the service life of the battery, especially lead-acid batteries. Undervoltage thresholds should therefore be set accordingly.Issue 2 - Affects Some Vehicle ApplicationsSome IR829 routers installed in vehicles might not shut down completely when the router's ignition management is enabled, and the vehicle's ignition switch is in the OFF position. Instead, the router will shut down momentarily and then automatically power up again, even though the vehicle's ignition switch is in the OFF position. This power off/on cycle repeats itself until the vehicle's ignition switch is back in the ON position.",

This is Cisco bug ID CSCvt47413.Also, an AP that performs a mandatory Channel Availability Check (CAC) for a channel that requires the use of DFS fails to complete the CAC if the Transmit power is changed during the CAC. The AP initiates beaconing immediately. This is Cisco bug ID CSCvt98797.Customers who operate APs with this software might be operating in violation of regulatory requirements.",
            "background": "APs use radio spectrum that is regulated by governments, which includes regulators such as the US Federal Communications Commission, the European Commission, or individual national authorities. All APs must adhere to the technical conditions imposed by regulators with respect to radio emissions. One mandatory technical requirement is DFS, which requires that APs operate in portions of the 5 GHz band to listen for civil and military radars, and when radar patterns are detected, to stop transmissions and change channels to avoid co-channel operation with these radars. DFS protects these military and civilian radar systems, which includes safety-of-life systems, from harmful interference.Software updates made available between February and June 2020 have impacted the ability of the specific devices to properly detect these radar events. As a result, APs that use the specific software version as listed in this document are out of compliance with regulatory requirements. All customers, regardless of location, should take the action recommended in this field notice. U.S.-based customers should also review FCC Enforcement Advisory No. 2019-06.Specifically, these 5 (five) AP Series are affected: AP2800, AP3800, AP4800, AP1560, and IW6300.If you do not upgrade to the fixed software version, in some jurisdictions you might be exposed to legal liability. You will be exposed if and only if:You operate affected APs, andThe APs run affected code, andYour APs operate on DFS channels now or will in the future.",
