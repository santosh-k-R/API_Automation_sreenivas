Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed Cisco ASA software release to remediate this issue. Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities: Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability Cisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability Cisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability Cisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability These vulnerabilities are independent of one another; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.

This vulnerability is related to the various gethostbyname functions included in glibc and affects applications that call these functions. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from an exploited system or, in some instances, perform remote code execution with the privileges of the application being exploited. The glibc library is a commonly used third-party software component that is released by the GNU software project and a number of Cisco products are likely affected. This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available. Cisco will release free software updates that address this vulnerability.

Only Typhoon-based line cards on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are affected by this vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to improper processing of packets that are routed via the bridge-group virtual interface (BVI) when any of the following features are configured: Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), policy-based routing (PBR), quality of service (QoS), or access control lists (ACLs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IPv4 packets through an affected device that is configured to route them via the BVI interface.

An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to reload unexpectedly. The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer, or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network. The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a malformed BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.

            "summaryText": "A vulnerability in Common Internet Filesystem (CIFS) code in the Clientless SSL VPN functionality of Cisco ASA Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a heap overflow. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the affected system. An exploit could allow the remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or potentially execute code. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects systems configured in routed firewall mode only and in single or multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 or IPv6 traffic. A valid TCP connection is needed to perform the attack. The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the Clientless SSL VPN portal. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.",

The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
