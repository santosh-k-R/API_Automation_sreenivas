            "title": "FN63942 - Wireless Lightweight Access Points and WLAN Controllers Fail to Create CAPWAP/LWAPP Connections Due to Certificate Expiration - Software Upgrade Recommended",
            "problemDescription": "Due to the certificate expiration, any new Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) or Light Weight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) connection will fail to establish. The main feature that is affected will be the Access Point (AP)-to-controller joining. The secondary feature that is affected will be new mobility connections between the controllers.When an AP attempts to establish a new connection, the AP fails to join. When you configure mobility between controllers, they will fail to establish a connection.The likelihood that this issue will be encountered is 100% for wireless products in use (to include APs and controllers) that have a Manufacturer Installed Certificate (MIC) that is older than ten years. Self-Signed Certificates (SSCs) that were generated by the Autonomous-to-lightweight Upgrade Tool will expire on January 1, 2020.The affected products (listed in the Products Affected section) were released prior to the end of CY2005; beginning in March 2015, the products might begin to experience these symptoms. The MICs of products not listed above will not start to expire until 2018.In order to help determine the potential future impact, a list of APs and Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and their release dates can be found in the Lightweight AP - Fail to create CAPWAP/LWAPP connection due to certificate expiration Cisco Support Forum article.",
            "problemSymptoms": "The wireless APs fail to connect to the WLCs. At the time of the join failure, the WLC msglog might show messages similar to this:Jul 10 16:13:52.443 spam_lrad.c:6164 LWAPP-3-PAYLOAD_ERR: Join request does not contain valid certificate in certificate payload - AP 00:11:22:33:44:55Example for WLC&#39;s MIC expiration case.*Aug 1 05:16:27.127: %PKI-3-CERTIFICATE_INVALID_EXPIRED: Certificate chain validation has failed.The certificate (SN: 423F49A800000005FEAE) has expired.

The MIC or SSC is used in order to authenticate the Lightweight AP to the WLC, and vice versa, during the DTLS session establishment. The CAPWAP/DTLS connection cannot be established after the MIC or SSC validity end date.",
