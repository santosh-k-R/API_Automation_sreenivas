The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: The failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device. Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",

This paper discusses seven vulnerabilities affecting session key negotiation in both the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocols. These vulnerabilities may allow the reinstallation of a pairwise transient key, a group key, or an integrity key on either a wireless client or a wireless access point. Additional research also led to the discovery of three additional vulnerabilities (not discussed in the original paper) affecting wireless supplicant supporting either the 802.11z (Extensions to Direct-Link Setup) standard or the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) standard. The three additional vulnerabilities could also allow the reinstallation of a pairwise key, group key, or integrity group key.

An attack could be executed by an attacker who can submit a stream of fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets that are designed to trigger the issue on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inefficient IPv4 and IPv6 fragment reassembly algorithms in the IP stack that is used by the affected kernel.
